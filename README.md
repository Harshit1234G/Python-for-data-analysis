This is my practice for this book https://github.com/Harshit1234G/Python-for-data-analysis/blob/master/0_python-for-data-analysis-data-wrangling-with-numpy--annas-archive--libgenrs-nf-3422197.pdf

I'm using this book as a roadmap, I know this book is a little old (uses python 3.10 and pandas 1.4) but almost all of the functionalities in this book are not deprecated since today.
